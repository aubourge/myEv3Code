myEv3Code
=========

Purpose of this repository is primarily to track my progress in understanding the ev3 code, and the dev of simple driver.
I am heavily leaning on ev3 sources (https://github.com/mindboards/ev3sources), obviously forked in my github space.

First target is to get motors working properly
Second traget is to get the basic sensors working properly
Another important target is to create a Makefile system able to cope with my desired final code architecture

First milestone would be to create an arm oscillation with color sensor readbacks at specific positions in order to get a
"scanner function"

I understand I might be re-inventing the wheel here, but at least I would have improved my understanding of the Lego EV3 
system.

Have fun reading my code a feel fre to comment / propose things !
